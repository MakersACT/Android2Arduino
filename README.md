Android2Arduino
===============

This is an Android-Processing-Arduino application which makes a connection between an Android device
and an Arduino using a server. The Android application creates a client socket in order to connect
with the server and send some data which are taken from the accelerometer sensor of the device. The server
is written in Processing language and creates a server socket which accepts all client socket calls and forwards
the incoming messeges to the Serial port. The Arduino application reads the values from the Serial port and does all
some fancy things!

You have the rights to copy the entire app or some code and change it 
only by declaring on the top the name of the creator.
