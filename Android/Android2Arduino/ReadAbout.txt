This is an Android application which connects to a server (in a computer) and sends some values.
It created in order to make a connection between an Android device and an Arduino using a server.
This application creates a socket and makes the connection with the server and sends some data
which are taken from the accelerometer sensor of the device.
If the user tilts (or shakes) the phone to the left the application sends a '1' to the server
and if the user tilts the phone to the right the application sends a '0' to the server.
The server's job is to forward this message to the Arduino in order to establish the connection
between the Android device and Arduino.
